üß¨ **Biomedical UMLS Knowledge Graph Pipeline**

This repository contains the complete implementation of a **biomedical knowledge graph construction pipeline** leveraging the **Unified Medical Language System (UMLS)**.  
It extracts **concepts**, **relationships**, **synonyms**, **semantic types**, and **definitions** from UMLS sources, processes the data, and loads it into a **Neo4j graph database**.
#  üöÄ Get Started
1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/jaaferklila/UMLS_knowledge_graph.git
```
```sh
cd UMLS_knowledge_graph
```
# üì• Download and Import the Graph
1Ô∏è‚É£ Install gdown (to download from Google Drive):
```sh
   pip install gdown
```
2Ô∏è‚É£ Go to the graph folder:
```sh
cd graph
```

3Ô∏è‚É£ Make the script executable:
```sh
chmod +x graph.sh
```

4Ô∏è‚É£ Run the script to download the graph:
```sh
./graph.sh
```

This will download a file called graph.zip into the graph folder.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Unzip the file:
```sh
unzip graph.zip
```
you will get a file named neo4j.dump (the graph database)

6Ô∏è‚É£ download Neo4j Desktop (Version 1.6.2) 

[Neo4j Desktop](https://neo4j.com/deployment-center/?desktop-gdb)

7Ô∏è‚É£ Move the dump file (for example graph.dump) into the import folder of your Neo4j installation.
8Ô∏è‚É£ Load the dump into your database with the following command:
```sh
bin/neo4j-admin database load neo4j --from-path=import --overwrite-destination=true
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Replace neo4j with the name of your database if you‚Äôre not using the default one.

üëâ After this, you can start your database from Neo4j Desktop and explore your graph üöÄ

## üì• Getting UMLS Data

To use this pipeline, you first need to obtain the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS). Please note that UMLS data is **licensed** and requires a valid license agreement to download.

### License and Download

- You must have a **UMLS license** to download the data.  
- Register and download the latest UMLS release from the official site:  
  [https://uts.nlm.nih.gov/license.html](https://uts.nlm.nih.gov/license.html)

### Available Files

The pipeline uses the following UMLS Metathesaurus files:

- `MRCONSO.RRF` ‚Äî Concept names, preferred terms, and synonyms.  
- `MRREL.RRF` ‚Äî Relationships between concepts (e.g., broader, narrower, related-to).  
- `MRSTY.RRF` ‚Äî Semantic types associated with each concept.  
- `MRDEF.RRF` ‚Äî Definitions for concepts.

## üõ† Graph Construction Pipeline

The graph construction follows the pipeline illustrated in the figure below:

## üóÑ Loading UMLS Data into MySQL

This section describes how to load the UMLS data files into a MySQL database for analysis.

###  Install MySQL
You will need  MySQL Workbench.  
Download it here: [https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/)

---
Creating a Database
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS umls CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci;
## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuring MySQL for UMLS Performance

Before loading the UMLS `.RRF` files into MySQL, it‚Äôs recommended to adjust MySQL settings for better performance.

### Edit MySQL Configuration

1. Open your MySQL configuration file:
- **Linux:**
```sh
sudo nano /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf
 ```
2. Under the [mysqld] section, add the following parameters:

```sh
[mysqld]
# Performance tuning for UMLS
key_buffer_size           = 600M
table_open_cache          = 300
sort_buffer_size          = 500M
read_buffer_size          = 200M
query_cache_limit         = 3M
query_cache_size          = 100M
myisam_sort_buffer_size   = 200M
bulk_insert_buffer_size   = 100M
join_buffer_size          = 100M

# Allow LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE
local_infile              = 1
```

3. Restart MySQL
 ```sh
sudo systemctl restart mysql 
```


4. go to mysql and add  :
```sh 
SET GLOBAL local_infile = 1;
```
```sh
exit;
```

![local_infile](images/sql.png)
### Data extraction & cleaning
1. CREATE DATABASE
 ```sh  
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS umls CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci;
```
6. Run Data Import Script

Before running the script, you may want to adjust `populate_mysql_db.sh` to include only the tables you want to create and load.

Then, make the script executable and run it:

```sh
chmod 775 populate_mysql_db.sh
./populate_mysql_db.sh
```
For more information, see the official UMLS documentation:  
 https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/implementation_resources/scripts/README_RRF_MySQL_Output_Stream.html
> After loading, you will have 4 main tables (`MRCONSO`, `MRREL`, `MRSTY`, and `MRDEF`) containing the UMLS data in your MySQL database.

## üîç Exploring and Analyzing UMLS Data

Once the UMLS `.RRF` files are loaded into MySQL, you will have several core tables that represent different aspects of the biomedical knowledge graph. The most important tables are:

| Table   | Description                                         |
|---------|---------------------------------------------------|
| MRCONSO | Contains concept names, synonyms, and identifiers |
| MRREL   | Stores relationships (edges) between concepts     |
| MRSTY   | Maps concepts to semantic types (categories)      |
| MRDEF   | Contains definitions and descriptions of concepts |

### üßπ Data Cleaning & Enrichment
After importing the UMLS `.RRF` data into MySQL, we perform a **data cleaning and enrichment** step to prepare it for **graph construction**.  

#### üìå Steps Performed

1. **Join Core UMLS Tables**  
   Associate each `CUI` with:  
   - ‚úÖ Preferred name (`MRCONSO`)  
   - ‚úÖ Synonyms (`MRCONSO`)  
   - ‚úÖ Definition (`MRDEF`)  
   - ‚úÖ Semantic types (`MRSTY`)  
   - ‚úÖ Relationships (`MRREL`)  

2. **Filter & Normalize**  
   - üåê Keep only **English terms** (`LAT='ENG'`)  
   - üóë Remove **duplicates** and **null values**  
   - üîñ filter by **vocabulary source** (`SAB`)  

3. **Aggregate Results**  
   - üß© Combine all information into **one enriched table**  
   - üìù Format **synonyms**, **semantic types**, and **relationships** as concatenated strings for easy export  

### üóÇ Enriched UMLS Relationships File

After the **data cleaning and enrichment** step, we generate a CSV file containing the enriched relationships between UMLS concepts.  

#### üìÑ Columns in the File
The CSV file `MRREL_with_STR_STY_defs_synonyms_clean.csv` contains the following columns:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| CUI1 | Concept Unique Identifier 1 |
| AUI1 | Atom Unique Identifier 1 |
| CUI2 | Concept Unique Identifier 2 |
| AUI2 | Atom Unique Identifier 2 |
| RUI | Relationship Unique Identifier |
| relation | Human-readable relation |
| STR1 | Concept 1 string |
| STR2 | Concept 2 string |
| CUI1_semtypes | Semantic types of CUI1 (concatenated) |
| CUI2_semtypes | Semantic types of CUI2 (concatenated) |
| Definitions1 | Definitions for CUI1 |
| Definitions2 | Definitions for CUI2 |
| Synonyms1 | Synonyms for CUI1 |
| Synonyms2 | Synonyms for CUI2 |

#### üìù Example Row
```csv
CUI1,AUI1,CUI2,AUI2,RUI,relation,STR1,STR2,CUI1_semtypes,CUI2_semtypes,Definitions1,Definitions2,Synonyms1,Synonyms2
